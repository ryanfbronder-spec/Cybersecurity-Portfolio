# Cybersecurity-Portfolio

In a world with exponentially advancing technology that can be utilized for both good and bad; I choose to utilize it for good.

My interest in cybersecurity stemmed from my career in the military. 

I enlisted as combat arms because I wanted to spearhead service and do good; It took a handful of strenuous years for me to realize that it was taking a toll on my body and that the risk was too high to maintain the profession.
I transitioned to human resources due to injuries sustained as combat arms and that was my first experience with any computer systems and programs. I ultimately did not feel fulfilled in that profession and decided it was time to end my military service.

Upon leaving the military, I felt lost like many other veterans; no direct mission or sense of purpose, working a stagnant 9-5 job with little to no true meaning other than providing myself sustenance. 
I yearned to do good again with a direct mission and a purpose; sustenance wasn't meaningful to me without substance.

With technology advancing and a need for a defensive posture against the harm it can do, I decided to combine and utilize my combat arms mentality, leadership, and skills along with my basic knowledge of computer systems and customer servicing / consulting in order to engage into the world of cybersecurity.

Without knowing what components were inside of a computer or how they worked; without any knowledge of cybersecurity SOPs or even what a kernel was, I decided to spearhead into the field starting my journey with SANS TI.

December 15th, 2023 I was accepted into the SANS TI Applied Cybersecurity Certification (ACS) Program and successfully completed the Program.
March 15th, 2025 I was accepted into the SANS TI Bachelor's Degree in Applied Cybersecurity (BACS) Program and have just successfully completed my first Fall NCL 2025 CTF Individual and Team Competition.

My CTF experience was more than I could have hoped for.

My skills were tested against the 9 technical competencies within cybersecurity as an individual and as a team captain.

The NCL Fall 2025 Individual Game was incredibly challenging. This was my first experience with field work and real-world exercises. Each competency maintaining challenges of difficulty ranging from "easy" to undoubtedly hard.
It was diffcult for me to mentally grasp how certain challenges were labeled as "easy"; however, that alone was a test of mental toughness and ultimately resiliency. Given the time-constraint and the vast amount of challenges, I was only able to attain the minimal required average completion of 60.7% amongst the 9 competencies.

I felt like a failure at first; as if I was swimming against the current of this competition.

I swallowed my pride, observed the standard bracket summary report and was pleasantly surprised to have scored better than 85% of my competition. This helped reaffirm confidence in myself and I was ready for the following NCL Fall 2025 Team Game.

Appointed as captain of 6 team members, I felt as if I was in my element as it was reminiscent of leading soldiers.

Being the captain of the team was a highlight for me as it affirmed my leadership, management and organizational skills. I took all individual score reports of my team members as well as myself and utilized an excel spreadsheet in order to best assign competencies per individual. There was consensus within my team and we spearheaded the challenges. Communication was fluent and assistance from each other was confidently asked and granted without question.

Witihin the SANS specific bracket, we placed 18th out of 110 teams; performing better than approximately 84% of our competition.

This NCL Fall 2025 CTF was an amazing experience and I look forward to many more CTFs.
